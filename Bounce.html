            <h1>Bounce</h1>
            <br>
            <p>In this tutorial, we are going to cover an intermediate strafing technique called 'Bounce'. Bounce is a concept that is only seemingly perfectible by a robot and many people would improve their surf by working on the level of Bounce in their strafes. Many of the fastest 'unit' surfers and B-Hoppers demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept and have implemented it into their muscle memory. We will cover a basic explanation of the 'Bounce' concept, and you can try the exercises to implement more Bounce into your strafes!
            <br><br>
            What is 'Bounce'?
            <br><br>    
            Bounce refers to the movement of the mouse when you change direction in a strafe. So, if you are strafing to the right and want to strafe to the left shortly after; Bounce refers to the transition period between those 2 strafes. There are 2 variables that decide the 'level' of Bounce in a strafe: Acceleration (and deceleration) and Pause.
            <br><br><br>    
            Acceleration
            <br><br>    
            Acceleration is the rate of change in movement over time, which includes a negative acceleration (like slowing down a movement).
            When we decide to strafe in the opposite direction our mouse is currently moving, we have to decelerate the mouse until it is at a complete stop, then accelerate the mouse in a new direction.
            <br>
            -- (This is when isolating away vertical mouse movements. If the mouse moves vertically when horizontal speed is at 0, the mouse will not be at a complete stop. Many B-hoppers have vertical movement in their Bounce). -- 
            <br><br><br>    
            Pause
            <br><br>    
            This, quite simply, refers to the amount of time the mouse is in a static state on the horizontal axis.
            <br><br><br>    
            If a strafe transition has a low amount of acceleration and a long pause, it is said to have a low level of Bounce.<br>
            If a strafe transition has a high amount of acceleration and a short pause, it is said to have a high level of Bounce.
            <br><br>    
            Sometimes we may be in circumstances which mean we have to have sub-optimal rates of acceleration, which will mean the quality of the Bounce will be largely determined by the length of the pause.
            <br><br>    
            When a strafe transition has a low level of bounce, the strafes will look 'Swooshy' as opposed to a robotic, 'clicky' like appearance.
            <br><br>    
            Ideally, our strafe transitions would have no discernible rate of Acceleration and no Pause, just an instant change of direction of mouse movement, synchronised with the strafing key. However, human muscular-skeletal ability and real world physics prevents us from achieving this. Even the greatest strafers have a short pause to allow them to change key before they move the mouse in the opposite direction, allowing for less error in synchronisation.
            <br><br>    
            Why is Bounce important?
            <br><br>    
            In Source-Mod Movement game modes, you gain speed while rotating at a certain, optimal, rate. We need to maximise the amount of time that we spend rotating at this rate and not at a sub-optimal rate (during deceleration, our rate will be sub-optimal).
            <br><br>
            The less time spent rotating, like the time spent paused, the less units we will gain.<br>
            The less time spent at a sub-optimal rate of rotation, the less units we will gain.<br><br>
            So, it is important to maximise our Bounce to maximise our unit gain from our strafes.
            <br><br>    
            How to practice?
            <br><br>    
            Most people can improve their Bounce simply by surfing and consciously thinking about the act of Bouncing. However, I have found it helps to Isolate the concept and practice moving the mouse horizontally, back and forth, while not surfing.
            I find it even more useful to have a visual aid, like to markers, that I can turn my view back and forth between, using the cross hair to guide my rotation. <br>
            If you spend 10-30 minutes a day just practicing your bounce as an intermediate, you will certainly have a significant improvement in the amount of units you gain from all strafes, especially strafes from a starting platform!</p>
