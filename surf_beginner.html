            <h3>Surf Beginner Guide</h3><br>
            <h5>Written by Orson (aka AngleCS)</h5>
            <br>               
            <p>Surf Beginner, one of the first maps we all play due to the name.<br> But most of us find it quite tricky at first! This guide will share my key tips for improving your time once you are already capable of completing the map in one shot.<br> These tips (along with good technique fundamentals) should be all that's required to get a truly fast time on the map.</p>
            <br><br>    
            <h5>Stage 1:</h5>
            <br>
            <p>Stage 1 is, for obvious reasons, very simple.<br> If you don't pay any attention to pathing, and rely solely on good fundamentals, you will get a passable time on this stage, no more than +0.10s. However, there are more things we can do to make sure we don't waste time on this stage.<br><br>
            Firstly, hitting an aggressive ramp strafe and staying high on the first ramp, reduces the distance we have to travel to the side, and thus reduces the total distance required to travel.<br> This has to be balanced out against the fact that you will have less XY speed for staying high.<br><br>
            Secondly, staying high, and having less speed than possible when flying to the portal, allows us to have more drop speed when hitting the portal and thus, landing earlier on stage 2.<br><br>
            Lastly, We can angle our entry into the portal to change the way we land onto stage 2, we want to keep some of our XY speed at the start of stage 2 so that we can move further from the center before we land on the stage 2 start platform.</p> 
            <br><br>
            <h5>Stage 2:</h5>
            <br>
            <p>Stage 2 again, is very simple. Many paths on the first ramp end of taking the same amount of time, due to the steepness of the ramp, the lower paths take energy away which could be preserved by staying higher, but higher is slower. Most options balance out to about the same time due to this fact.<br>
            What is most important about this stage is cutting the corner between the first and second ramp so that you use a very small amount of the second ramp. Also hitting a great ramp strafe to preserve as much end speed as possible.<br>
            Also, just like stage 1, we can angle our portal entry to land further left on stage 3.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>Stage 3:</h5>
            <br>
            <p>Stage 3 is another simple stage. We want to get low on the first ramp early, whilst still boarding the top of the ramp.
            This is because we don't have enough space to get the most units out of the ramp, and we want to leave the ramp from as low as possible to remove as much drop into the 2nd ramp as possible.<br> 
            It is important to leave early, so as to have a clean cut around the pillar wall.<br> 
            The 2nd ramp presents a difficult trade-off, however. If we cut the corner, landing on the 2nd close to the end portal, we are then forced to have a sharp ascent into the end portal, but save time on the approach. Alternatively, we can travel more directly towards the 2nd ramp, allowing us to stay higher and get a better drop into the 4th stage.<br>
            Many times, the CPR for a run will look faster because someone has cut the corner more aggressively, but they will lose time on the drop which is not reflected in the CPR.<br>
            We can also have a small amount of portal entry based drop manipulation so we can land further from the centre on stage 4.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>Stage 4:</h5>
            <br>
            <p>On stage four,  we want to board the first ramp crouched, and smoothly surf to the bottom of the ramp. We want to rise slightly to give us room to smoothly transition over the joint of the first ramp, and leave through the bottom window in the wall with as flat of an angle as possible. This will feel like you are ascending slightly through the window but this is due to the perspective that is a constant descent.<br>
            When we are through the window, we want to quickly move towards an appropriate board position for the 2nd, hit a good ramp-strafe, and leave the last ramp from the tip, with as much drop as possible for stage 5.<br>
            Like stage 3, leaving the last ramp lower than the tip will manipulate the CPR into looking faster than the run actually is.<br>
            In this way, a run can look faster through stage 3 and 4 whilst actually being slower than a similar run with a higher CPR.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>Stage 5:</h5>
            <br>
            <p>The first ramp on stage 5 is simple, however we want to pass through a very low point on the ramp, which is only achievable by delaying the ascent to the flick. This means our descent curve will be smoother than our ascent, but we will be able to leave lower from the ramp.<br> 
            Leaving lower from the ramp is faster, however much more difficult as you will have less fall speed to drop through the gap between ramps.<br>
            Remember to crouch over the foot-check and under the head-check. It may be better to release crouch between these checks as you will be rotating at ~1200-1300u/s.<br>
            It is important to stay high on the 2nd ramp, due to the same reason as stage 1, reducing the distance traveled away from the end portal horizontally. Also, as the 2nd ramp is descending, we can have a more aggressive board than we typically expect from the perspective.<br>
            Leave the last ramp from the tip, and try to gain as much drop as possible when landing in the portal, as low as possible.<br>
            Around the pillars on the stage, it is better to give yourself more leverage to balance the apex of the turn, especially around the 2nd pillar.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>Stage 6:</h5>
            <br>
            <p>There aren't many quirks to the first ramp, I find it best to have a smooth descent and ascent curve by using the entire height of the ramp, but many world records have stayed slightly high on the ramp, sharpening their ascent.<br>
            Once we get past the head-check, we want to ascend as soon as possible whilst ensuring we reduce the moon over the foot-check. 
            Strafe out to the side to allow you to board the 2nd ramp close to the end portal, again this provides a units/distance tradeoff which you can play with.<br>
            We want to bhop late on the platform so that we board the 3rd ramp with a positive Y axis speed to allow a more aggressive board.<br>
            We want to leave the 3rd ramp early to give us a stronger drop into the last stage.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>Stage 7:</h5>
            <br>
            <p>The first ramp should be surfed with the harsh joint in mind, smoothly managing the descent curve and gaining space to smoothen out the joint.<br> 
            The stage 7 skip can be very difficult, and the optimal way is not required to get a top 10 time (at least for now in Feb 2020).<br>
            You could easily get a 45:80 while taking a nice wide curve round to gain leverage on the 2nd ramp board.
            However, for an optimal time, we should leave the 1st ramp early, cutting the pillar wall close, hitting an aggressive ramp-strafe.<br>
            Units over the wall are lost this way, however having more units over the wall gives you less space to work with for the 3rd ramp and often takes me further away from the end zone.<br>
            With the RNG fix, it seems you can have quite a harsh fall onto the bhop platform, so the 3rd ramp should be surfed quite high, flattening out your fall before you leave, and trying to reduce speed loss during the turn.<br>
            If you get a bhop on the platform, count your lucky stars, its worth about 0.10s for free, but a WR should be removed if this isn't consistently do-able (which at the time of writing, isnt consistent).
            <br><br>
            I hope that this guide helps you to improve your time on the surf_beginner, make sure that you work on your fundamentals as a good time on this map heavily depends on your ability to strafe and ramp-strafe.<br><br>
            Best of luck !
