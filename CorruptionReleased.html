                        <p>In this tutorial, we are going to cover an advanced strafing technique called 'Bounce'.<br> Bounce is a concept that is only seemingly perfectible by a robot and many people would improve their surf by working on the level of Bounce in their strafes.</p>

            <h1>Surf Corruption is complete!</h1>
            <br>
            <h5>17th Feb 2020</h5>
            <br>
            <p>After a long development process, the wait is finally over, Surf_Corruption has been released.<br> Development of Corruption started in the summer of 2018, and has eagerly been awaited as one of, if not THE, hardest surf maps. <br> Oliver, the map maker, was a holder of more than 15 World Records at the time and wanted to push the surf community to a new level.<br> We caught up with Oliver for his thoughts now the map has been released.</p>
            <br><br>
            <h5>First question, is the map tier 7?</h5>
            <br>
            <p>Oliver thinks the map should be considered tier 7 but also that other maps like Goliath and Devil should also be considered tier 7.<br> We all expect, however, that the tier system isn't going to change just yet and the map will be added as a tier 6.</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>Why did the map take so long to make?</h5>
            <br>   
            <p>''I was lazy and bad at hammer so it took a long time, also there were many periods where I completely stopped when I lost motivation"</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>Why did you make Corruption, What was the motivation?</h5>
            <br>   
            <p>"After I got the surf_not_so_zen record, I wanted to make another very long and very difficult map, which would play into my skill set, like Not-So-Zen but longer and harder!<br> I wanted it to take as long to complete as it took to get a decent world record.<br> I also wanted to make a map that would be considered the hardest map for a good couple years, at least.<br> It was self serving really, I just wanted a good map that was something fun to surf."</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>What are the best features of the map?</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"Well, I would say 'the surf' even if any inexperienced mapper can make 'good surf' I was trying to take advantage of being able to test the map as often as possible to improve the surf.<br> I also added 2 crouched head-surfs, but they didn't have a large impact on the map, even if I would like them to have.<br> They are kinda a gimmicky thing to get used to.<br> I wanted a head-surf that takes the crouch-surf penalty into account so the surfer would have to be more careful.<br> I've had people say the ramps are badly placed but I thought the main criticism would be that the map: 'lacks detail, 'has bad lighting' or 'looks boring', because during development it was difficult to change.<br> I know there is a combination of 'lack of overall detail' and no dynamic lighting but that would take a lot of extra work and testing."</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>How many hours did it take to make?</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"Hours total? I have no idea... A long time for sure.<br> It's too scattered throughout the 2 years, much longer than it would take any half experienced mapper though."</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>Why should people surf Corruption?</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"Well, its pretty well recognised as one of the hardest maps, and there is always going to be prestige for whoever completes it.<br> Also, I think the surf is really fun, smooth, semi-awkward, difficult and long.<br> Another thing is, that a lot of difficult maps don't have curved ramps so Corruption is quite unique.<br> Most long, difficult, maps don't have curved ramps due to ramp-bugs which kinda sucks for a longer map."</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>What is the best section?</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"Ermm... The tree room. I like how much people struggled with it, it's really fun, and its great that people found it so difficult!"</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>Oh, well, what is the hardest part of the map?</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"If you are using saveloc, probably the tree room; and it might be in run also.<br> The ending is pretty chokeable but not as bad as the tree room, even though it is likely to feel more difficult due to it being at the end."</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>How long do you think it will take before someone completes the map?</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"Depends... Really difficult to say, people have had access for a long time to earlier versions.<br> Corruption was made to be the most difficult map, mid to late 2018.<br> It's 2 years after that and people have gotten a lot better at the game in general as well.<br> Anyone can put a decent amount of time into it and get it in like 2 weeks, If not earlier, I have no idea how good people have gotten."</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>It was meant for 2018 difficulty but, didn't you make it harder as you went along?</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"Yes, I made it harder, but not to where its up to the standards of today.<br> I was trying to reach some level above the 2018 standard and by making it harder progressively.<br> I haven't made it to that level compared to the current skill level."</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>Name 3 surfers, who you think are the most likely to complete first.</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"Rulldar... Levi... Caff. I think Caff has proven himself on longer maps like Looksmodern and I think he has the ability.<br> It's more of a guess, maybe someone like Saxton or Simex would take spot 3"</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>Why Snorlax?</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"I had this running meme on my stream, because I had this Snorlax pillow in the background as a mascot so I thought it would be fun to put him in the map, especially as I streamed some of the mapping process. It made sense... It had to be done!"</p>
            <br><br>   
            <h5>Are you going to complete the map yourself?</h5>
            <br><br>   
            <p>"Probably not, unless I come back at some point, but I did complete an earlier version of the map which was a tad easier."</p><br>
