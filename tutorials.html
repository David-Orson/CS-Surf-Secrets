            <br>
            <p>In this tutorial, we are going to cover an advanced strafing technique called 'Bounce'.<br> Bounce is a concept that is only seemingly perfectible by a robot and many people would improve their surf by working on the level of Bounce in their strafes.<br> Many of the fastest 'unit' surfers and B-Hoppers demonstrate a clear understanding of the concept and have implemented it into their muscle memory.<br><br> We will cover a basic explanation of the 'Bounce' concept, and you can try the exercises to implement more Bounce into your strafes!..</p><br>
